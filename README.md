## What is Growth Mind Set?

Growth mind set is a type of outlook at life. There are two types of mindsets that one can have. [Dr. Carol Dweck of Stanford University](https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-is-growth-mindset-8-steps-develop-one1904.html#close) does a great job explaining what is a group mindset.

This is a personal based definition of what a growth mindset is and this blog is to be taken with a grain of salt. The following are things that help me have a growth mindset.
