        JavaScript is a programming language for the web.
        In JavaScript, variable are declared under keywords <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong>. These key words have similar functions and are very different at the same time. When are variable is created, they are asigned a value which can either be a string or a number and not forgetting the other <strong>data types</strong>.

        When debugging, which is a fancy way of saying when finding problems within a piece of code. The code used to check whether the code is running correctly is called <strong>console.log(</strong>variables<strong>)</strong>. JavaScript has somethings called built in functions, which are a set of functions that have already been written by very smart people. One of these built in function is the <strong>prompt()</strong> function. This function will prompt the user to input some data which can later be used to accomplish a set of commands that we pass when writing our code.
<pre>
<code>
    let name = promp('What is your name?');
    let cookie = prompt('What is your favorite ice-creame between vanilla, chocolate and strawberry?');

    if (cookie === 'vanilla') {
        document.write(`Hello, ${name}. Your ${cookie} is on it's way.`)
    } else if (cookie === 'chocolate') {
        document.write(`Hello, ${name}. Your ${cookie} is on it's way.`)
    } else if (cookie === 'strawberry') {
        document.write(`Hello, ${name}. Your ${cookie} is on it's way.`)
    } else {
        document.write(`Cookie monster is coming to get you!! Muhahaha`)
    }
