                    Wireframe is a practice used by UX designers. It is a hierarchy of how websites are designed.This hierarchy of things in a website allows developers to create a code of conduct and uniformity on all websites that are created around the world. Wireframe examples are:
                </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                        Wireframe drawn on a piece of paper.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Wireframe digitally designed on a computer.
