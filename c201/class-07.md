# Reading OOP and HTML Table

## Understanding Tables

**Questions that will be answered by the end of the this reading**
- How are tables created?
- What information suits tables?
- How to represent complex data in table?

There are four key elements for creating tables. But first, we must answer the most basic question on this topic. What is a table? A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results. Tables are made using the **table** element then  a **thead** element to signify the head of the table and finally a **tbody** to signify the body of the table. Within the *thead* and *tbody* elements, there are **tr** which stand for table row. Within the *tr* there is **td** which stands for table data. 

This information is self explainatory, is it not? The table row holds the information about the data which will be inputted in table data.

## Object Oriented Programming

There are many ways to create an object and efficiency is key when programming. One of the most efficient ways to create an object without having to retype the same code over and over again is by using the constructor method. 
The *new* keyword is used to create an object instance from the parent constructor.
