### Positions

**What is position static**

If an element is defined as static, then the element will always have the position as per the normal page flow. This is the condition when nothing is defined as an element in an HTML page design. It is also the default value. The static element does not change its position.

**What is position fixed**

If an element is defined as static, then the element will always have the position which is fixed with respect to the viewpoint or page. It always resides in the same place even if we scroll the page.

**What is absolute position?**

Although the name is absolute, if an element is defined as absolute, then the element will always have the position which is relative with respect to its nearest neighbor element instead of the viewpoint or page. If there is no neighbor, it will be positioned relative to the body of the document and its movement is in liaise with scrolling of the page

**What is relative position**

If an element is defined as relative, then the element will always have the position according to the defined values of its position like: left, right, top, bottom relative to the normal position, and its movement is in liaise with scrolling of the page.

**What is sticky position**

If an element is defined as relative, then the element will always follow the scrolling of the page and sticks to scrolling. Sticky elements never leave the user as he or she scrolls the webpage.
